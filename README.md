 Application Design and Function

 As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
 so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profile.


 # My Task and Application Requirments

  - Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

  - Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

  - Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

  - Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

  - Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

  - Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

  - Have a polished UI.

  - Be responsive.

  - Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

  - Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

  - Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

  - Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

  - Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

  - Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

    ├── index.html               // runs the application
